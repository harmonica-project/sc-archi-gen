# Solidity microservice architecture benchmarking

## Introduction

The goal of this Javascript program is to convert a representation of a BPMN diagram to a microservice architecture made of smart-contracts, then benchmarking the execution of the BPMN from start to end. 

For now, the benchmark executes every step of the BPMN but the goal is to benchmark random paths.

## Requirements

- truffle
- node.js
- solidity (v > 5.x)
- ganache-cli
